<h2>Orientation of/for the Workshop</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>This workshop assumes some basic familiarity with working in
<code>R</code> such as what you might obtain in the “Introduction to R”
workshop or in a statistics course that uses <code>R</code> heavily,
such as STAT 217 or STAT 411/511. If you have not interacted with
<code>R</code> previously, some of the assumptions of your background
for this workshop might be a barrier. We would recommend getting what
you can from this workshop and you can always revisit the materials at a
later date after filling in some of those basic <code>R</code> skills.
We all often revisit materials and discover new and deeper aspects of
the content that we were not in a position to appreciate in a first
exposure.</p></li>
<li><p>In order to focus this workshop on coding, we developed this
interactive website for you to play in a set of “sandboxes” and try your
hand at implementing the methods we are discussing. When each code chunk
is ready to run (all can be edited, many have the code prepared for
you), you can click on “Run Code”. This will run <code>R</code> in the
background on a server. For the “Challenges”, you can get your answer
graded although many have multiple “correct” answers, so don’t be
surprised if our “correct” answer differs from yours. The “Solution” is
also provided in some cases so you can see a solution - but you will
learn more by trying the challenge first before seeing the answer. Each
sandbox functions independently, which means that you can pick up
working at any place in the documents and re-set your work without
impacting other work (this is VERY different from how <code>R</code>
usually works!). Hopefully this allows you to focus on the code and what
it does… The “Start over” button can be used on any individual sandbox
or you can use the one on the left tile will re-set all the code chunks
to the original status.</p></li>
<li><p>These workshops are taught by Sara Mannheimer, Greta Linse, and
Mark Greenwood and co-organized by the MSU Library, Statistical
Consulting and Research Services (SCRS), and the Department of
Mathematical Sciences. More details on us and other workshops are
available at the end of the session.</p></li>

<h2>Data Wrangling using <strong><code>dplyr</code></strong> &amp;
<strong><code>tidyr</code></strong> Intro</h2>
<p>Note that we’re not using “data manipulation” for this workshop, but
are calling it “data wrangling.” To us, “data manipulation” is a term
that captures the event where a researcher manipulates their data (e.g.,
moving columns, deleting rows, merging data files) in a
<strong>non-reproducible</strong> manner. Whereas, with data wrangling,
all of these process are done, but in a <strong>reproducible</strong>
manner, such as using an <code>R</code> script!</p>
<p>Packages in <code>R</code> are basically sets of additional functions
that let you do more stuff. The functions we’ve been using so far, like
<code>str()</code> or <code>data.frame()</code>, come built into
<code>R</code>; packages give you access to more of them. Before you use
a package for the first time you need to install it on your machine, and
then you should import it in every subsequent <code>R</code> session
when you need it. You should already have installed the
<strong><code>tidyverse</code></strong> package. This is an
“umbrella-package” that installs several packages useful for data
analysis which work together well such as
<strong><code>tidyr</code></strong>,
<strong><code>dplyr</code></strong>,
<strong><code>ggplot2</code></strong>,
<strong><code>tibble</code></strong>, etc.</p>
<p>The <strong><code>tidyverse</code></strong> package tries to address
3 common issues that arise when doing data analysis with some of the
functions that come with <code>R</code>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The results from a base <code>R</code> function sometimes depend on
the type of data.</li>
<li>Using <code>R</code> expressions in a non-standard way, which can be
confusing for new learners.</li>
<li>Hidden arguments, having default operations that new learners are
not aware of.</li>
</ol>
<p>We have seen in our previous lesson that when building or importing a
data frame, the columns that contain characters (i.e., text) are coerced
(=converted) into the <code>factor</code> data type. We had to set
<strong><code>stringsAsFactors</code></strong> to
<strong><code>FALSE</code></strong> to avoid this hidden argument to
convert our data type.</p>
<p>This time we will use the <strong><code>tidyverse</code></strong>
package to read the data and avoid having to set
<strong><code>stringsAsFactors</code></strong> to
<strong><code>FALSE</code></strong></p>
<p>In order to install the <code>tidyverse</code> package, you can type
<code>install.packages("tidyverse")</code> straight into the RStudio
console. In fact, it’s better to write this in the console than in a
script for any package, as there’s no need to re-install packages every
time we run the script. If you work in a .Rmd (R-markdown) format, any
missing packages will be identified and a prompt added to the top of the
document about installing the packages.</p>
<p>Then, to load the package we would need to type:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>## load the tidyverse packages -- including dplyr, tidyr, readr, stringr
library(tidyverse)</code></pre>
<div id="section-what-are-dplyr-and-tidyr" class="section level3">
<h3>What are <strong><code>dplyr</code></strong> and
<strong><code>tidyr</code></strong>?</h3>
<p>The package <strong><code>dplyr</code></strong> is built to work
directly with data frames, with many common tasks optimized by being
written in a compiled language (C++). An additional feature is the
ability to work directly with data stored in an external database. The
benefits of doing this are that the data can be managed natively in a
relational database, queries can be conducted on that database, and only
the results of the query are returned.</p>
<p>This addresses a common problem with <code>R</code> in that all
operations are conducted in-memory and thus the amount of data you can
work with is limited by available memory. The database connections
essentially remove that limitation in that you can connect to a database
of many hundreds of GB, conduct queries on it directly, and pull back
into <code>R</code> only what you need for analysis.</p>
<p>The package <strong><code>tidyr</code></strong> addresses the common
problem of wanting to reshape your data for plotting and use by
different <code>R</code> functions. Sometimes we want data sets where we
have one row per measurement. Sometimes we want a data frame where each
measurement type has its own column, and rows are instead more
aggregated groups - like plots or aquaria. Moving back and forth between
these formats is nontrivial, and <strong><code>tidyr</code></strong>
gives you tools for this and more sophisticated data wrangling.</p>

<strong><code>tidyr</code></strong> after the workshop, you may want to

<h3>Presentation of the Survey Data</h3>
<p>The data used in this workshop are a time-series for a small mammal
community in southern Arizona. This is part of a project studying the
effects of rodents and ants on the plant community that has been running
for almost 40 years, but we will focus on the years 1996 to 2002
(<em>n</em>=11332 observations). The rodents are sampled on a series of
24 plots, with different experimental manipulations controlling which
rodents are allowed to access which plots. This is simplified version of
the full data set that has been used in over 100 publications and was
provided by the Data Carpentries (<a
href="https://datacarpentry.org/ecology-workshop/data/"
class="uri">https://datacarpentry.org/ecology-workshop/data/</a>). We
are investigating the animal species diversity and weights found within
plots in this workshop. The dataset is stored as a comma separated value
(CSV) file. Each row holds information for a single animal, and the
columns represent:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Column</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>record_id</td>
<td>Unique id for the observation</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>month</td>
<td>month of observation</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>day</td>
<td>day of observation</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>year</td>
<td>year of observation</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>plot_id</td>
<td>ID of a particular plot</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>species_id</td>
<td>2-letter code</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>sex</td>
<td>sex of animal (“M”, “F”)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>hindfoot_length</td>
<td>length of the hindfoot in mm</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>weight</td>
<td>weight of the animal in grams</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We’ll read in our data using the <code>read_csv()</code> function,
from the tidyverse package <strong><code>readr</code></strong>, instead
of <code>read.csv()</code>.</p>

<p>You will see the message <code>Column specification</code>, followed
by each column name and its data type. When you execute
<code>read_csv</code> on a data file, it looks through the first 1000
rows of each column and guesses the data type for each column as it
reads it into <code>R</code>. For example, in this dataset,
<code>read_csv</code> reads <code>weight</code> as
<code>col_double</code> (a numeric data type), and <code>species</code>
as <code>col_character</code>. You have the option to specify the data
type for a column manually by using the <code>col_types</code> argument
in <code>read_csv</code>.</p>

<p>The data set is stored as a “tibble”. Tibbles tweak some of the
behaviors of the data frame objects we introduced previously. The data
structure is very similar to a data frame. For our purposes the only
differences are that:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>In addition to displaying the data type of each column under its
name, it only prints the first few rows of data and only as many columns
as fit on one screen.</li>
<li>Columns of class <code>character</code> are never converted into
factors.</li>
</ol>
<p>We’re going to learn some of the most common
<strong><code>dplyr</code></strong> functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>select()</code>: subset columns</li>
<li><code>filter()</code>: subset rows on conditions</li>
<li><code>mutate()</code>: create new columns by using information from
other columns</li>
<li><code>group_by()</code> and <code>summarize()</code>: create summary
statistics on grouped data</li>
<li><code>arrange()</code>: sort results</li>
<li><code>count()</code>: count discrete values</li>
</ul>

<h3>Selecting Columns and Filtering Rows</h3>
<p>To select columns of a data frame, use <code>select()</code>. The
first argument to this function is the data frame
(<code>surveys</code>), and the subsequent arguments are the columns to
keep.</p>
<p>Modify the following code to select the <code>plot_id</code>,
<code>species_id</code>, and <code>weight</code> columns from the
<code>survey</code> dataset:</p>

<p>To select all columns <em>except</em> certain ones, put a “-” in

</div>
<p>In the code above <code>==</code> keeps all rows where the year is
1999.</p>
<p>Other filtering options include <code>!=</code>, which keeps all rows
that are <strong>not</strong> a certain criteria, <code>,</code> which
means <strong>“and”</strong>, and <code>|</code> which means
<strong>“or”</strong>. Filter can also do <code>&lt;</code> for “less
than”, <code>&gt;</code> for “greater than”, <code>&lt;=</code> for
“less than or equal to”, and <code>&gt;=</code> for “greater than or
equal to”. We type these last two options the same way we would
typically say them.</p>

<h3>Pipes</h3>
<p>What if you want to select and filter at the same time? There are
three ways to do this: use intermediate steps, nested functions, or
pipes.</p>
<p>With intermediate steps, you create a temporary data frame and use
that as input to the next function, like this:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="pipes-example-1"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>surveys2 &lt;- filter(surveys, weight &lt; 6)
surveys_sml &lt;- select(surveys2, species_id, sex, weight)</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>This is readable, but can clutter up your workspace with lots of
objects that you have to name individually. With multiple steps, that
can be hard to keep track of.</p>
<p>You can also nest functions (i.e., one function inside of another),
like this:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="pipes-example-2"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>surveys_sml &lt;- select(filter(surveys, weight &lt; 6), species_id, sex, weight)</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>This is handy, but can be difficult to read if too many functions are
nested, as R evaluates the expression from the inside out (in this case,
filtering, then selecting).</p>
<p>The last option, <em>pipes</em>, are a more recent addition to
<code>R</code>. Pipes let you take the output of one function and send
it directly to the next, which is useful when you need to do many things
to the same dataset. Pipes in <code>R</code> look like
<code>%&gt;%</code> and are made available via the
<strong><code>magrittr</code></strong> package, installed automatically
with <strong><code>dplyr</code></strong>. If you use RStudio, you can
type the pipe with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> if
you have a PC or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> if you
have a Mac.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="pipes-example-3"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>surveys %&gt;%

</div>
<p>In the above code, we use the pipe to send the <code>surveys</code>
dataset first through <code>filter()</code> to keep rows where
<code>weight</code> is less than 6, then through <code>select()</code>
to keep only the <code>species_id</code>, <code>sex</code>, and
<code>weight</code> columns. Since <code>%&gt;%</code> takes the object
on its left and passes it as the first argument to the function on its
right, we don’t need to explicitly include the data frame as an argument
to the <code>filter()</code> and <code>select()</code> functions any
more.</p>
<p>Some may find it helpful to read the pipe like the word “then”. For
instance, in the above example, we took the data frame
<code>surveys</code>, <em>then</em> we <code>filter</code>ed for rows
with <code>weight &lt; 6</code>, <em>then</em> we <code>select</code>ed
columns <code>species_id</code>, <code>sex</code>, and
<code>weight</code>. The <strong><code>dplyr</code></strong> functions
by themselves are somewhat simple, but by combining them into linear
workflows with the pipe, we can accomplish more complex wrangling of
data frames.</p>
<p>If we want to create a new object with this smaller version of the
data, we can assign it a new name:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="pipe-rename-example"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>surveys_sml &lt;- surveys %&gt;%

  select(species_id, sex, weight)

surveys_sml</code></pre>

</div>
<p>Note that the final data frame is the leftmost part of this
expression.</p>

<h3>Mutate</h3>
<p>Frequently you’ll want to create new columns based on the values in
existing columns, for example to do unit conversions, or to find the
ratio of values in two columns. For this we’ll use
<code>mutate()</code>.</p>

<h3>Using <code>lubridate</code> for Dates</h3>
<p>Date-time data can be frustrating to work with in <code>R</code>,
since <code>R</code> commands for date-times are generally un-intuitive
and change depending on the type of date-time object being used.
Moreover, the methods we use with date-times must be robust to time
zones, leap days, daylight savings times, and other time related quirks,
and <code>R</code> lacks these capabilities in some situations. The
<code>lubridate</code> package makes it easier to do the things
<code>R</code> does with date-times and possible to do things that base
<code>R</code> does not.</p>
<p><code>Lubridate</code> has functions that handle easy parsing of
times, such as:</p>

<h3>The <code>case_when()</code> Function</h3>
<p>We notice that the labels for the days of the week are not
necessarily what we would like to have for a graphical display of our

<p>There are small differences between character data types and factor
data types. Typically, <code>R</code> uses factors to handle categorical
variables, variables that have a fixed and known set of possible values.
Factors are also helpful for reordering character vectors to improve
display. However, factors are often difficult to work with. Enter the
<code>forcats</code> package, whose goal is to provide a suite of tools
that solve common problems with factors, including changing the order of
levels or the values.</p>
<p>The order of the levels <code>R</code> chose may not be what we
wanted, but we can reorder them using the <code>fct_relevel()</code>
function from the <code>forcats</code> package (the <a
href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/factors.pdf"><code>forcats</code>
cheatsheet link</a>. The function takes three arguments:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>the data</li>
<li>the factor to be reordered</li>
<li>the order of the new levels separated by commas</li>
</ol>
<p>This process looks like this:</p>

<h2>Split-Apply-Combine Data Analysis</h2>
<p>Many data analysis tasks can be approached using the
<em>split-apply-combine</em> paradigm: split the data into groups, apply
some analysis to each group, and then combine the results.
<strong><code>dplyr</code></strong> makes this very easy through the use
of the <code>group_by()</code> function.</p>
<div id="section-the-summarize-function" class="section level3">
<h3>The <code>summarize()</code> Function</h3>
<p><code>group_by()</code> is often used together with
<code>summarize()</code>, which collapses each group into a single-row
summary of that group. <code>group_by()</code> takes as arguments the
column names that contain the <strong>categorical</strong> variables for
which you want to calculate the summary statistics. So to compute the
mean <code>weight</code> by sex:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="groupby-example"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>surveys_edited %&gt;%
  group_by(sex) %&gt;%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE))</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>One of the advantages of <code>tbl_df</code> over data frame is that
is provides more compact output, although the current format of these
materials makes that hard to see.</p>
<p>You can also group by multiple columns:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="groupby-example2"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>surveys_edited %&gt;%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %&gt;%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE))</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>When grouping both by <code>sex</code> and <code>species_id</code>,
the last row is for animals that escaped before their sex and body
weights could be determined. You may notice that the last column does
not contain <code>NA</code> but <code>NaN</code> (which refers to “Not a
Number”). To avoid this, we can remove the missing values for weight
before we attempt to calculate the summary statistics on weight. Because
the missing values are removed first, we can omit
<code>na.rm = TRUE</code> when computing the mean:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="groupby-example3"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>surveys_edited %&gt;%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %&gt;%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %&gt;%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight))</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>If you want to display more data, you can use the
<code>print()</code> function at the end of your chain with the argument
<code>n</code> specifying the number of rows to display:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="groupby-example4"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>surveys_edited %&gt;%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %&gt;%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %&gt;%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight)) %&gt;%
  print(n = 15)</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>Once the data are grouped, you can also summarize multiple variables
at the same time (and not necessarily on the same variable). For
instance, we could add a column indicating the minimum weight for each
species for each sex:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="summarize-example1"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>surveys_edited %&gt;%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %&gt;%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %&gt;%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight),
            min_weight = min(weight))</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>It is sometimes useful to rearrange the result of a query to inspect
the values. For instance, we can sort on <code>min_weight</code> to put
the lighter species first:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="summarize-example2"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>surveys_edited %&gt;%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %&gt;%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %&gt;%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight),
            min_weight = min(weight)) %&gt;%
  arrange(min_weight)</code></pre>

</div>
<p>To sort in descending order, we need to add the <code>desc()</code>
function. If we want to sort the results by decreasing order of mean
weight:</p>

<h3>Counting</h3>
<p>When working with data, we often want to know the number of
observations found for each factor or combination of factors. For this
task, <strong><code>dplyr</code></strong> provides <code>count()</code>.
For example, if we wanted to count the number of rows of data for each
sex, we would do:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="count-example1"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>surveys_edited %&gt;%
    count(sex) </code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>The <code>count()</code> function is shorthand for something we’ve
already seen: grouping by a variable, and summarizing it by counting the
number of observations in that group. In other words,
<code>surveys %&gt;% count()</code> is equivalent to:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="count-example2"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>surveys_edited %&gt;%
    group_by(sex) %&gt;%
    summarize(count = n())</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>For convenience, <code>count()</code> provides the <code>sort</code>
argument:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="count-example3"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>surveys_edited %&gt;%
    count(sex, sort = TRUE) </code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>The previous example shows the use of <code>count()</code> to count
the number of rows/observations for <em>one</em> factor (i.e.,
<code>sex</code>). If we wanted to count the <em>combination of
factors</em>, such as <code>sex</code> and <code>species</code>, we
would specify the first and the second factor as the arguments of
<code>count()</code>:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="count-example4"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>surveys_edited %&gt;%
  count(sex, species_id) </code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>With the above code, we can proceed with <code>arrange()</code> to
sort the table according to a number of criteria so that we have a
better way to compare groups. For instance, we might want to arrange the
table above in (i) an alphabetical order of the levels of the species
and (ii) in descending order of the count:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="count-example5"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>surveys_edited %&gt;%
  count(sex, species_id) %&gt;%
  arrange(species_id, desc(n))</code></pre>

</div>
<p>From the table above, we may learn that, for instance, there are 72
observations of the <em>albigula</em> species (<code>species_id</code> =
“NL”) for males.</p>

<h2>Relational Data with <code>dplyr</code></h2>
<p>It is rare that data analyses, especially with longitudinal
measurements, involve only a single table of data. More typically, you
have multiple tables of data, describing different aspects of your
study. When you embark on analyzing your data, these different data
tables need to be combined. Collectively, multiple tables of data are
called <em>relational data</em>, as the data tables are not independent,
rather they relate to each other.</p>
<p>Relations are defined between a pair of data tables. There are three
families of joining operations: mutating joins, filtering joins, and set
operations. Today we will focus on mutating joins.</p>
<p>The <code>survey</code> data have two other data tables they are
related to: <code>plots</code> and <code>species</code>. Load in these
data and inspect them to get an idea of how they relate to the

<p>There are two types of keys:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <em>primary key</em> uniquely identifies an observation in its own

</li>
<li>A <em>foreign key</em> uniquely identifies an observation in another
table.</li>
</ul>
<p>A primary key and the corresponding foreign key form a
<em>relation</em> between the two data tables. These relations are
typically many-to-one, though they can be 1-to-1. For example, there are
many rodents captured that are of one species_id, hence a many-to-one
relationship.</p>
<p>For me, the easiest way to think about the relationships between the
different data tables is to draw a picture:</p>

<h3>Joining Relational Data</h3>
<p>The tool that we will be using is called a <em>mutating join</em>. A
mutating join is how we can combine variables from two tables. The join
matches observations by their keys, and then copies variables from one
table to the other. Similar to <code>mutate()</code> these join
functions add variables to the right of the existing data frame, hence
their name. There are two types of mutating joins, the inner join and
the outer join.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-inner-join" class="section level3">
<h3>Inner Join</h3>
<p>The simplest join is an <em>inner join</em>, which creates a pair of
observations whenever their keys are equal. This join will output a new
data frame that contains the key, the values of <code>x</code>, and the
values of <code>y</code>. Importantly, this join deletes observations
that do not have a match.</p>

<h3>Outer Join</h3>
<p>While an inner join only keeps observations with keys that appear in
both tables, an <em>outer join</em> keeps observations that appear in
<em>at least one</em> of the data tables. When joining <code>x</code>
with <code>y</code>, there are three types of outer join:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <em>left join</em> keeps all of the observations in
<code>x</code>.<br />
</li>
<li>A <em>right join</em> keeps all of the observations in
<code>y</code>.<br />
</li>
<li>A <em>full join</em> keeps all of the observations in both
<code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.</li>

<p>The left join is the most common, as you typically have a data frame
(<code>x</code>) that you wish to add additional information to (the
contents of <code>y</code>). This join will preserve the contents of
<code>x</code>, even if there is not a match for them in
<code>y</code>.</p>

<h3>Joining <code>surveys_edited</code> Data</h3>
<p>To join the <code>surveys_edited</code> data with the
<code>plots</code> data and <code>species</code> data, we will need two
join statements. As we are interested in adding this information to our
already existing data frame, <code>surveys_edited</code>, a left join is
the most appropriate.</p>

<h2>Reshaping Data</h2>
<p>Data Carpentry’s <a
href="https://datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/01-format-data/">spreadsheet
lesson (link)</a>, discusses how to structure our data leading to the
four rules defining a tidy dataset:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Each variable has its own column</li>
<li>Each observation has its own row</li>
<li>Each value must have its own cell</li>
<li>Each type of observational unit forms a table</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="images/tidy-data.png" /></p>
<p>Here we examine the fourth rule: Each type of observational unit
forms a table.</p>
<p>In <code>surveys_edited</code> , the rows of
<code>surveys_edited</code> contain the values of variables associated
with each record (the unit), values such as the weight or sex of each
animal associated with each record. What if instead of comparing
records, we wanted to compare the different mean weights of each genus
between plots? (Ignoring <code>plot_type</code> for simplicity).</p>
<p>We’d need to create a new table where each row (the unit) is
comprised of values of variables associated with each plot. In practical
terms this means the values in <code>genus</code> would become the names
of column variables and the cells would contain the values of the mean
weight observed on each plot.</p>
<p>Having created a new table, it is therefore straightforward to
explore the relationship between the weight of different genera within,
and between, the plots. The key point here is that we are still
following a tidy data structure, but we have <strong>reshaped</strong>
the data according to the observations of interest: average genus weight
per plot instead of recordings per date.</p>
<p>The opposite transformation would be to transform column names into
values of a variable.</p>
<p>We can do both these of transformations with two <code>tidyr</code>
functions, <code>pivot_longer()</code> and
<code>pivot_wider()</code>.</p>
<p><img src="images/tidyr-pivot_wider_longer.gif" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<div id="section-pivoting-to-a-wider-table" class="section level3">
<h3>Pivoting to a Wider Table</h3>
<p><code>pivot_wider()</code> takes three principal arguments:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>the data<br />
</li>
<li>the column whose values will become new column names.<br />
</li>
<li>the column whose values will fill the new columns.</li>
</ol>
<p>Further arguments include <code>fill</code> which, if set, fills in
missing values with the value provided.</p>
<p><img src="images/pivot_wider_graphic.png" width="538" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Let’s use <code>pivot_wider()</code> to transform surveys to find the
mean weight of each genus in each plot over the entire survey period. We
use <code>filter()</code>, <code>group_by()</code> and
<code>summarize()</code> to filter our observations and variables of
interest, and create a new variable for the <code>mean_weight</code>. We
use the pipe as before too.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="gw-example"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>surveys_gw &lt;- combined %&gt;%

</div>
<p>This yields <code>surveys_gw</code> where the observations for each
plot are spread across multiple rows, 164 observations of 3
variables.</p>
<p>Using <code>pivot_wider()</code> to pivot on <code>genus</code> with
values from <code>mean_weight</code> this becomes 24 observations of 9
variables, one row for each plot. We again use pipes:</p>

number of genera per plot as the values. You will need to summarize
before reshaping, and use the function <code>n_distinct()</code> to get
the number of unique genera within a particular chunk of data. It’s a
powerful function! See <code>?n_distinct</code> or go to <a

<h3>Pivoting to a Longer Table</h3>
<p>The opposing situation could occur if we had been provided with data
in the form of <code>surveys_wide</code>, where the genus names are
column names, but we wish to treat them as values of a genus variable
instead. This task is extremely common in longitudinal data where the
columns are the measurement events over time on the same variable and
the rows are for the locations or subjects and we want to align all the
responses in one long vector for plotting (e.g., <code>ggplot</code>) or
analyses.</p>
<p>In this situation we are gathering the column names and turning them
into a pair of new variables. One variable represents the column names
as values, and the other variable contains the values previously
associated with the column names.</p>
<p><code>pivot_longer()</code> takes four principal arguments:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>the data</li>
<li>the columns we wish to pivot into a single column</li>
<li>the name of the new column to create to store the names of each
selected column</li>
<li>the name of the new column to create to store the data filled in
each cell</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="images/pivot_longer_graphic.png" width="538" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>To recreate <code>surveys_gw</code> from <code>surveys_wide</code> we
would create a key called <code>genus</code> and value called
<code>mean_weight</code> and use all columns except <code>plot_id</code>
for the key variable. Here we drop the <code>plot_id</code> column with
a minus sign.</p>

<p>Note that now the <code>NA</code> genera are included in the
re-gathered format. Pivoting your data to a wide format and then
pivoting to a long format can be a useful way to balance out a dataset
so every replicate has the same composition and you can see where you
could have obtained observations.</p>
<p>We could also have used a specification for what columns to include.
This can be useful if you have a large number of identifying columns,
and it’s easier to specify what to gather than what to leave alone. And
if the columns are in a row, we don’t even need to list them all out -
just use the <code>:</code> operator!</p>

<h2>Exporting Data</h2>
<p>Now that you have learned how to use
<strong><code>dplyr</code></strong> to extract information from or
summarize your raw data, you may want to export these new data sets to
share them with your collaborators or for archival.</p>
<p>Similar to the <code>read_csv()</code> function used for reading CSV
files into <code>R</code>, there is a <code>write_csv()</code> function
that generates CSV files from data frames.</p>
<p>Before using <code>write_csv()</code>, it is good to create a new
folder, <code>data</code>, in our working directory that will store the
generated datasets. It is best to avoid writing generated datasets in
the same directory as our raw data as that may create confusion later
about which data set was the source and which was the “wrangled”
version. So it is good practice to keep them separate. The
<code>data_raw</code> folder should only contain the raw, unaltered
data, and should be left alone to make sure we don’t delete or modify
it. In contrast, our script will generate the contents of the
<code>data</code> directory, so even if the files it contains are
deleted, we can always re-generate them. If you were working in RStudio,
the following code would create a <code>data</code> directory inside the
folder where your .Rmd exists.</p>
<pre><code>if(!dir.exists(&quot;data&quot;)){dir.create(&quot;data&quot;)}</code></pre>
<p>For future use, we might want to prepare a cleaned up version of the
dataset that doesn’t include any missing data.</p>
<p>Let’s start by removing observations of animals for which
<code>weight</code> and <code>hindfoot_length</code> are missing, or the
<code>sex</code> has not been determined:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="data-cleanup-exercise"

<pre class="text"><code>surveys_complete &lt;- surveys_edited %&gt;%

         !is.na(hindfoot_length),  # remove missing hindfoot_length
         !is.na(sex))                # remove missing sex

</div>
<p>If we were interested in plotting how species abundances have changed
through time, we might also want to remove observations for rare species
(i.e., that have been observed less than 50 times). We will do this in
two steps: first we are going to create a data set that counts how often
each species has been observed, and filter out the rare species; then,
we will extract only the observations for these more common species:</p>

</div>
<p>We can check that <code>surveys_complete_subset</code> has 11266 rows
and 11 columns by typing <code>dim(surveys_complete_subset)</code> in
the previous sandbox.</p>
<p>Now that our data set is ready, we can save it as a CSV file in our
<code>data</code> folder.</p>
