## Data Viz Introduction

**`ggplot2`** is a plotting package that makes it simple to create complex plots
from data in a data frame. It provides a more programmatic interface for
specifying what variables to plot, how they are displayed, and general visual
properties. Therefore, we only need minimal changes if the underlying data 
change or if we decide to change from a bar plot to a scatter plot. This helps 
in creating publication quality plots with minimal amounts of adjustments and 
tweaking.

Packages in `R` are basically sets of additional functions that let you do more
stuff. The functions we've used in the previous session, like `str()` or `mean()`,
come built into `R`; packages give you access to more of them. Before you use a
package for the first time you need to install it on your machine, and then you
should import it in every subsequent `R` session when you need it. 

>
> Install the **tidyverse** package by going to `Packages > Install` and
> typing tidyverse into the dialog box. Keep "Install dependencies" checked.
> You can also run `install.packages("tidyverse")` from the console.
>

This is an "umbrella-package" that installs several packages useful for data
analysis which work together well such as **`tidyr`**, **`dplyr`**, 
**`ggplot2`**, **`readr`**, **`forcats`**, etc.

The **`tidyverse`** package tries to address common issues that arise when
doing data analysis with some of the functions that come with `R`. 

1. The `tidyverse` solves complex problems by combining many simple pieces.

> "No matter how complex and polished the individual operations are, 
> it is often the quality of the glue that most directly determines 
> the power of the system."
>
> --- Hal Abelson

2. The `tidyverse` is written for people to read! 

> "Computer efficiency is a secondary concern because the 
> bottleneck in most data analysis is thinking time, not computing time."
>
> --- Hadley Wickham

It is important to note that there's no need to re-install packages every time 
we run the script.

Then, to load the package include code in your work with:
  
```{r echo=TRUE, message = FALSE}
## load the tidyverse packages
library(tidyverse)
```

Working with packages was discussed in more detail in the "Introduction to R"
session. We will proceed through the remaining work with the `tidyverse` package
installed and loaded.

To learn more about **`ggplot2`** after the workshop, you may want
to check out this
[**`ggplot2`** reference website (link)](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/) 
and this [handy cheatsheet on **`ggplot2`** (link)](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/data-visualization-2.1.pdf).


### Presentation of the Survey Data

The data used in this workshop are a time-series for a small mammal community in southern Arizona. This is part of a project studying the effects of rodents and ants on the plant community that has been running for almost 40 years, but we will focus on the years 1996 to 2002 (_n_=11332 observations). The rodents are sampled on a series of 24 plots, with different experimental manipulations controlling which rodents are allowed to access which plots. This is simplified version of the full data set that has been used in over 100 publications and was provided by the Data Carpentries (https://datacarpentry.org/ecology-workshop/data/). We are going to focus on animal species diversity and weights in this workshop. The dataset is stored as a comma separated value (CSV) file in the "data" folder.

\newpage

Each row holds information for a single animal, and the columns represent (along with some others we will not use):

| Column           | Description                        |
|------------------|------------------------------------|
| record\_id       | Unique id for the observation      |
| month            | month of observation               |
| day              | day of observation                 |
| year             | year of observation                |
| plot\_id         | ID of a particular plot            |
| species\_id      | 2-letter code                      |
| sex              | sex of animal ("M", "F")           |
| hindfoot\_length | length of the hindfoot in mm       |
| weight           | weight of the animal in grams      |


We'll read in our data using the `read_csv()` function, from the tidyverse 
package **`readr`**, instead of `read.csv()` used in the previous session.

```{r load-data}
surveys <- read_csv("data/surveys2.csv")
```

You will see the message `Parsed with column specification`, followed by each 
column name and its data type. When you execute `read_csv` on a data file, it 
looks through the first 1000 rows of each column and guesses the data type for 
each column as it reads it into `R`. For example, in this dataset, `read_csv` 
reads `weight` as `col_double` (a numeric data type), and `species` as 
`col_character`. 

```{r inspect-data, message=TRUE}
## inspect the data
str(surveys)

```

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
## Preview the data
View(surveys)
```

At the top of the `str()` output, notice that the class of the data is a tibble. Tibbles tweak some of the behaviors of the 
data frame objects we introduced in the previous workshop. The data structure is
very similar to a data frame, so for our purposes the only differences are that:

1. In addition to displaying the data type of each column under its name, it
   only prints the first few rows of data and only as many columns as fit on one
   screen.
2. Columns of class `character` are never converted into factors.


## Plotting with **`ggplot2`**

`ggplot2` functions like data in the 'long' format, i.e., a column for every 
dimension, and a row for every observation. There are other data formats, which 
we will discuss in the _Data Wrangling in `R`_ session, as well as how to 
convert from one data format to another. Well-structured data will save you 
lots of time when making figures with `ggplot2` and when working in `R`!

`ggplot()` graphics are built step by step by adding new elements. Adding layers 
in this fashion allows for extensive flexibility and customization of plots.

To build a `ggplot()`, we will use the following basic template that can be used 
for different types of plots:

`ggplot(data = <DATA>, mapping = aes(<VARIABLE MAPPINGS>)) +  <GEOM_FUNCTION>()`

Let's go through this step by step!  

1. Use the `ggplot()` function and bind the plot to a specific data frame using 
the `data` argument

    ```{r bind-plot}
    ggplot(data = surveys)
    
    ## Creates a blank ggplot(), referencing the surveys dataset
    ```

2. Define a mapping (using the aesthetic (`aes`) function), by selecting the 
variables to be plotted and specifying how to present them in the graph, e.g. as
x/y positions or characteristics such as size, shape, color, etc.

    ```{r define-mapping}
    ggplot(data = surveys, 
           mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length))
    #
    # Creates a blank ggplot(), with the variables mapped to the x- and y-axis
    # ggplot() knows where the variables live, since you have defined the data to use
    ```

3. Add "geoms" -- graphical representations of the data in the plot (points,
  lines, bars). **`ggplot2`** offers many different geoms; we will use some 
  common ones today, including:
  
      * `geom_point()` for scatter plots, dot plots, etc.
      * `geom_boxplot()` for boxplots
      * `geom_bar()` for bar charts
      * `geom_line()` for trend lines, time series, etc.

    To add a geom to the plot use the `+` operator. Because we have two continuous 
    variables in the data, let's use `geom_point()` first:

    ```{r add-to-plots}
    ggplot(data = surveys, 
           mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
      geom_point()
    
     # Adds a point for each row (observation) in the data  
    ```

You can think of the `+` sign as adding layers to the plot. 
Each `+` sign must be placed at the end of the line containing the *previous* 
layer. If, instead, the `+` sign is added at the beginning of the line 
containing the new layer, **`ggplot2`** will not add the new layer and will 
return an error message.

```{r plus-sign, error=TRUE}

# This will not add the new layer and will return an error message
ggplot(data = surveys, 
       mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) 
  + geom_point()

```


### Building Plots Iteratively 

Building plots with **`ggplot2`** is typically an iterative process. We start by
defining the dataset we'll use, lay out the axes, and choose a geom:

```{r build-plot}
ggplot(data = surveys, 
       mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
    geom_point()
```

\newpage

Then, we start modifying this plot to extract more information from it. For
instance, we can add transparency (`alpha`) to the points, to avoid 
overplotting:

```{r modify-plot}
ggplot(data = surveys, 
       mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.2)
    ## alpha reduces the opacity of the points 
    ## 0 is fully transparent
    ## 1 is the original opacity
```

We can also add colors for all the points:

```{r color-plot}
ggplot(data = surveys, 
       mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.2, color = "blue")
```


`geom_point` also accepts aesthetics of size and shape. 
The size of a point is its width in mm. The shape of a point has five 
different options for plotting:  

* an integer [0, 25] of defined plotting characters -- same as base `R`
* the name of the shape in quotations (e.g. "circle open" or "diamond filled")
* a single character, to use that character as a plotting symbol
* a "." to draw the smallest point that is visible -- typically 1 pixel
* an NA, to draw nothing

Reference for shapes in integers and characters:  
https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2-specs.html

```


```{r challenge-1-solution}
ggplot(data = surveys, 
       mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.2, color = "blue", shape = "diamond")

```

### Piping Data In  

Because **`ggplot2`** lives in the `tidyverse`, it is expected to work well with 
other packages in the `tidyverse`. Because of this, the first argument to 
creating a `ggplot()` is the dataset you wish to be working with. The pipe 
operator sends the output of one function directly into the next function,
which is useful when you need to do many things to the same dataset. Since the 
dataset we wish to use is the first argument to `ggplot()`, we can use the pipe 
operator to pipe the data into the `ggplot()` function!  

Pipes in `R` look like `%>%` and are made available via the **`magrittr`** 
package, installed automatically with the **`tidyverse`**. If you use RStudio, 
you can type the pipe with `Ctrl + Shift + M` if
you have a PC or `Cmd + Shift + M` if you have a Mac.

>**Note:** There is now (as of R 4.1.0) a native R pipe `|>` that works similar 
> to the `%>%` pipe operator with minor differences that you may encounter, but 
> since we are working in the `tidyverse` we will stick with their pipe operator
> (`%>%`). If you want to switch which pipe operator is used with the shortcut
> keys, you can go to `Tools > Global Options... > Code` and check (or uncheck) 
> the option "Use native pipe operator, |> (requires R 4.1+)".
> 


This would instead look like this:  

```{r pipe-example}
surveys %>%  
  ## data to be used in the ggplot  
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) + 
  ## uses the data piped in as the first argument to ggplot() 
    geom_point(alpha = 0.2, color = "blue")
```

Once we pipe the data in, the first argument becomes the `mapping` of the 
aesthetics. Technically, we are using the name of this argument, which is why it
looks like:  

`mapping = aes(<VARIABLES>)`

When we pipe our data in, the first argument then becomes this `mapping` 
argument. 

### Assigning More Variables to Aesthetics 

To color each species in the plot differently, you could use a vector as an
input to the argument **color**. **`ggplot2`** will provide a different color 
corresponding to different values in the vector. Here is an example where we 
color with **`species_id`**:

```{r color-example1, fig.height=3, fig.width=6}
surveys %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.2, aes(color = species_id)) 

```

**Note:** When specifying an `alpha` for a scatterplot, it automatically uses 
that __same__ `alpha` in the legend. To remedy this you can add:  

`guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 1)))`

to your plot. This customizes the legend appearance, similar to what we will 
see in the customization section. 

We can also specify the colors directly inside the mapping provided in the 
`ggplot()` function. This will be seen by **any** geom layers and the mapping 
will be determined by the x- and y-axis set up in `aes()`.

```{r color-example2, fig.height=3, fig.width=6}
surveys %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length, color = species_id)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.2)
```

Notice that we can change the geom layer and colors will be still determined by
**`species_id`**


### Local Aesthetics versus Global Aesthetics 

When you define aesthetics in the `ggplot()` function, those mappings hold for
**every** aspect of your plot. 

For example, if you chose to add a smoothing line to your plot of weight versus 
hindfoot length, you would get different lines depending on where you define 
your color aesthetics. 

**Globally** 

```{r color-global, fig.height=3, fig.width=6}
surveys %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length, color = species_id)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.2) + 
  geom_smooth()
  ## smoothing line for each species_id -- because color is defined globally
```

**Locally**  

```{r color-local, fig.height=3, fig.width=6}
surveys %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color = species_id), alpha = 0.2) + 
  geom_smooth()
  ## one smoothing line -- no color defined globally
```

  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color = plot_type), alpha = 0.2) + 
  geom_smooth()

```

### Challenge 2 (Part 2)

```{r challenge-2part2}
## Your ggplot() code for the challenge goes here!


```

```{r challenge-2part2-solution}
surveys %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = plot_id, y = weight)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color = plot_type), alpha = 0.2) + 
  geom_smooth()

```


### Boxplots & Violin Plots

Boxplots provide a visualization of a quantitative variables across different levels of a categorical (grouping) variable. For example, we can use boxplots to visualize the distribution of weight within each species:

```{r boxplot1}
surveys %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = species_id, y = weight)) +
    geom_boxplot()
```

By adding points to boxplot, we can have a better idea of the number of
measurements and their distribution:

```{r boxplot2}
surveys %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = species_id, y = weight)) +
    geom_boxplot(alpha = 0) + 
    ## alpha = 0 eliminates the black (possible outlier) points, so they're not plotted twice
    geom_jitter(alpha = 0.2, color = "tomato")
    ## alpha = 0.2 decreases the opacity of the points, to not be too busy
```

> Notice how the boxplot layer is behind the jitter layer? What would you 
> change in the code to put the boxplot in front of the points?


### Challenge 3 (Part 1) 

>
> Boxplots are useful summaries, but hide details of the *shape* of the
> distribution. For example, if the distribution is bimodal, we would not see 
> it in a boxplot. A superior density plot is the violin plot, where the shape 
> (of the density of points) is drawn.
>
> Replace the box plot with a violin plot. For help see `geom_violin()`. 
> Start with the boxplot we created:
>

```{r challenge-3part1-example}
ggplot(data = surveys, mapping = aes(x = species_id, y = weight)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.2, color = "tomato")
```

```{r challenge-3part1}
##  Start with the boxplot we created
##  1. Replace the boxplot with a violin plot. For help, see geom_violin().
##  You might need to decrease opacity even more to see the violins (try 0.03)

```

```{r challenge-3part1-solution}
surveys %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = species_id, y = weight)) +
    geom_violin() + 
    geom_jitter(alpha = 0.03, color = "tomato")

```


### Challenge 3 (Part 2)

>
> So far, we've looked at the distribution of weight within species. Let's try 
> making a new plot to explore the distribution of another variable within each 
> species.
>
> Create a boxplot for `hindfoot_length`. This time overlay the boxplot layer 
> over a jitter layer that shows the actual measurements.
>

```{r challenge-3part2}
##  First: create boxplot for hindfoot_length` overlaid on a jitter layer.

```

```{r challenge-3part2-solution}
surveys %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = species_id, y = hindfoot_length)) +
    geom_jitter(alpha = 0.3, color = "tomato") +
    geom_boxplot(alpha = 0) 

```



### Challenge 3 (Part 3)

>
> Now, add color to the data points on your boxplot according to the plot from 
> which the sample was taken (`plot_id`).
>
> *Hint:* Check the class for `plot_id`. If `plot_id` was a character instead, 
> how would the graph be different?  
>

```{r challenge-3part3}
## Next: add color to the data points on your boxplot according to the
## plot from which the sample was taken (plot_id).

## Hint: Check the class for plot_id`. If plot_id was a character instead, 
## how would the graph be different? 

```

```{r challenge-3part3-solution}
surveys %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = species_id, y = hindfoot_length)) +
    geom_jitter(alpha = 0.3, mapping = aes(color = plot_id)) +
    geom_boxplot(alpha = 0) 

## Checking the data type for plot_id
class(surveys$plot_id)

## Creating a new variable named plot_id_chr
## which is the character version of plot_id
surveys <- surveys %>% 
  mutate(plot_id_chr = as.character(plot_id))

## Using new character plot_id to make a boxplot
surveys %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = species_id, y = hindfoot_length)) +
    geom_jitter(alpha = 0.3, mapping = aes(color = plot_id_chr)) +  
    geom_boxplot(alpha = 0)  

```


### Bonus violin plot example (DatasauRus)

>
> The previous example doesn't fully illustrate the power of violin plots. 
> This example from the `datasauRus` package
> (https://www.autodeskresearch.com/publications/samestats) shows five different
> distributions that have exactly the same summary statistics and boxplots but
> very different shapes:
>

```{r datasaurus, message = FALSE}
library(datasauRus)
data(box_plots)

box_plots_long <- box_plots %>%
  pivot_longer(cols=1:5)
  
box_plots_long <- box_plots_long %>%
  rename(Example=name, Response=value)

box_plots_long <- box_plots_long %>% 
  mutate(Example = factor(Example))

ggplot(box_plots_long, aes(x=Example, y=Response)) +
  geom_violin(fill="bisque") +
  geom_boxplot(alpha=.6) +
  geom_jitter(alpha=0.15, col="tomato") +
  theme_minimal() + 
  scale_x_discrete(labels=c('Trimodal, Right Skew', 'Clumpy', 'Normal', 
                            'Trimodal, Left Skew',  'Bimodal'))
```


## Plotting Single Variables

### Distribution Plots (Quantitative Variables)

If we wish to visualize the distribution of a single quantitative variable, our 
plot changes a bit. Unfortunately, the `geom_violin()` function only accepts 
groups, so we cannot make a violin plot with no groups. Darn it!  

But, a violin is simply a density plot that's been reflected across the y-axis. 
So, we could likely suffice with a density plot.  

To visualize the distribution of rodent weights we could aggregate over all 
species, years, plots, etc. and produce a single density plot:  


```{r dist-plot}
surveys %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = weight)) + 
  geom_density()
  
```

The default is an empty density plot, which is largely unsatisfying. By adding 
a `fill = <COLOR>` argument to `geom_density()` we can produce a nicer looking 
plot:  

```{r dist-add-color}
surveys %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = weight)) + 
  geom_density(fill = "sky blue")
  
```

Another frequently used plot for a single quantitative variable is the 
histogram. The same plot as above can be recreated using `geom_histogram()` 
instead of `geom_density()`. However, when you use `geom_histogram()` it gives 
you a warning. 

```{r hist}
surveys %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = weight)) + 
  geom_histogram()

```


> What warning do you get and why?
> Do you get an error like this when you use `hist()` in base `R`? 

```{r}
hist(surveys$weight)
```


There is no single right answer for the number of bins. There are some "plug-in" choices for number of bins that can be used, but you are always welcome to explore different numbers of bins to see if features you are seeing persist when you choose more or less bins.  


### Challenge 4 

>
> Use the `bins` argument in `geom_histogram()` to play around with the number
> of bins in your histogram. Try different numbers of bins to explore how that
> changes the results! 
>


```{r challenge-4}
## Your code to answer the challenge goes here!


```

```{r challenge-4-solution}
surveys %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = weight)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "sky blue" , bins = 50)

```


### Bar Charts  (Categorical Variables)

At first glimpse, you would think that a bar plot would be simple to create, but
bar plots reveal a subtle nuance of the plots we have created thus far. The 
following bar chart displays the total number of rodents in the `surveys` 
dataset, grouped by their species ID. 

```{r bar1}
surveys %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = species_id)) + 
  geom_bar()
```

The x-axis displays the levels of `species_id`, a variable in the 
`surveys` dataset. On the y-axis `count` is displayed, but `count` is 
**not** a variable in our dataset! Where did `count` come from? Graphs, such as
the scatterplots, display the raw values of your data. Other graphs, like bar 
charts and boxplots, calculate new values (from your data) to plot. 

*  Bar charts and histograms bin your data and then plot the number of 
observations that fall in each bin.

*  Boxplots find summaries of your data (min, max, quartiles, median) and plot 
those summaries in a tidy box, with "potential outliers" (data over 1.5*IQR from
Q1 or Q3) plotted as points.

*  Smoothers (as used in `geom_smooth`) fit a model to your data (you can 
specify, but we used the `gam` (generalized additive model from the `mgcv`
package) default) and then plot the predicted means from that model (with
associated 95% confidence intervals).


To calculate each of these summaries of the data, `R` uses a different 
statistical transformation, or *stat* for short. With a bar chart this looks 
like the following process:  

1. `geom_bar` first looks at the entire data frame  
2. `geom_bar` then transforms the data using the `count` statistic  
3. the `count` statistic returns a data frame with the number of observations 
(rows) associated with each level of `species_id`  
4. `geom_bar` uses this summary data frame, to build the plot -- levels of 
`species_id` are plotted on the x-axis and `count` is plotted on the y-axis  

Generally, you can use `geoms` and `stats` interchangeably. This is because
every `geom` has a default `stat` and vice versa. For example, the following
code produces the same output as above:  

```{r bar2}
surveys %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = species_id)) + 
  stat_count()
```

If you so wish, you could override the default `stat` for that `geom`. For
example, if you wanted to plot a bar chart of proportions you would use the
following code to override the `count` stat:  

```{r bar3}
surveys %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = species_id)) + 
  geom_bar(aes(y = after_stat(prop), group = 1))
```


### Challenge 5

> Why do we need to set `group = 1` in the above proportion bar chart? 
> In other words, what is wrong with the plot below?  
>

```{r bar4}
## What is wrong with this plot? 
surveys %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = species_id)) + 
  geom_bar(aes(y = after_stat(prop)))

```


### Colored and/or Stacked Bar Charts

Another piece of visual appeal to creating a bar chart is the ability to use 
colors to differentiate the different groups, or to plot two different variables
in one bar chart (stacked bar chart). Let's start with adding color to our bar
chart.  

#### Coloring Bars 

As we saw before, to add a color aesthetic to the plot we need to map it to a 
variable. However, if we use the `color` option that we used before we get a 
slightly unsatisfying result.  

```{r bar5, fig.height=3, fig.width=6}
surveys %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = species_id, color = species_id)) + 
  geom_bar()
```

We notice that the color only appears in the outline of the bars. For a bar 
chart, the aesthetic that we are interested in is the `fill` of the bars.  


>## Challenge 6 
>
> Change the code below so that each bar is filled with a different color. 

```{r challenge-6-example, fig.height=3, fig.width=6}
surveys %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = species_id, color = species_id)) + 
  geom_bar()
```

```{r challenge-6}


```

```{r challenge-6-solution}
surveys %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = species_id, fill = species_id)) + 
  geom_bar()

```


#### Stacking Bars 

Now suppose you are interested in whether the number of male and female rodents captured differs by species. This would require for you to create a bar plot with 
two categorical variables. You have two options:  

1. each of the bars for sex could be stacked within a species *OR* 
2. the bars for sex could be side-by-side within a species  

Let's see how the two approaches differ. To stack bars of a second categorical 
variable we would instead use this second categorical variable as the `fill` of
the bars. Run these two lines of code and see how they differ. 

```{r stacking}
surveys %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = species_id, fill = sex)) + 
  geom_bar()

surveys %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = species_id, fill = sex)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")
```

In the first plot, the position was chosen automatically, but in the second plot
the `position` argument was made explicit. What changes did this make in the 
plots? 

Finally, we can also choose the `position` to be `fill` for the bars and to `fill` the bars based on `sex`:

```{r stacking2}
surveys %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = species_id, fill = sex)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "fill")
```

Notice that the y-axis label still says "count" instead of "proportion". We will 
learn how to change labels later when we discuss [**Customization**](#customization).


## Time-series Data

Let's calculate number of counts per year for each genus. 

*Preview of Data Wrangling:* First we need to group the data and count 
records within each group!  

```{r timeseries1}
yearly_counts <- surveys %>%
  count(year, genus) 
  ## counts the number of observations (rows) for each year, genus combination 
  ## and creates a new variable "n" and creates a new variable "n"

yearly_counts
```

Time series data can be visualized as a line plot with years on the x-axis and 
counts on the y-axis: 

```{r timeseries2}
yearly_counts %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = n)) +
     geom_line()
```

Unfortunately, this does not work because we plotted data for all the genera
together. We need to tell `ggplot()` to draw a line for each genus by modifying
the aesthetic function to include `group = genus`:

```{r timeseries3}
yearly_counts %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = n, group = genus)) +
    geom_line()
```

Unfortunately, we can't tell what line corresponds to which genus. We will be 
able to distinguish genera in the plot if we add colors (using `color` also 
automatically groups the data):

```{r timeseries4}
yearly_counts %>% 
ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = n, color = genus)) +
    geom_line()
```

>**Note:** When specifying the color for a line graph, you don't need to use both the 
>`color = <VARIABLE>` argument and the `group = <VARIABLE>` argument. Both do the 
>same grouping of observations! So you just need to specify the `color` argument.


### Faceting

**`ggplot2`** has a special technique called *faceting* that allows the user to 
split one plot into multiple plots based on a categorical variable included in 
the dataset. 

There are two types of `facet` functions:

* `facet_wrap()` arranges a one-dimensional sequence of panels to allow them to 
cleanly fit on one page -- used for one variable
* `facet_grid()` allows you to form a matrix of rows and columns of panels --
used for two variables  

Both geometries allow you to specify faceting variables using formula notation
or the `vars()` function. We will use the formula notation, as you will use this
notation when creating models (not covered in this workshop).

This looks like: `facet_wrap(facets = ~ facet_variable)` or 
`facet_grid(row_variable ~ col_variable)`. 

Let's start by using `facet_wrap()` to make a time series plot for each species:

```{r facet1, fig.height=3, fig.width=6}
yearly_counts %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = n)) +
    geom_line() +
    facet_wrap(facets = ~ genus)
```

Now we would like to split the line in each plot by the sex of the rodent 
captured. To do that we need to make counts in the data frame grouped by `year`,
`species_id`, and `sex`:

```{r facet2}
yearly_sex_counts <- surveys %>%
  count(year, species_id, sex)
## counts the number of observations (rows) for each year, species, sex combination

yearly_sex_counts
```

We can now make the faceted plot by splitting further by sex using `color` 
(within each panel):

```{r facet3, fig.height=4, fig.width=6}
yearly_sex_counts %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = n, color = sex)) +
    geom_line() +
    facet_wrap(facets =  ~ species_id)
```

You can also organize the panels only by rows (or only by columns), using the 
optional `nrow` and `ncol` arguments:

```{r facet4, fig.height = 8.5, fig.width = 8}
yearly_sex_counts %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = n, color = sex)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ species_id, ncol = 1)
  # One column, facet by rows
```

```{r facet5, fig.width = 9.5, fig.height = 5}
yearly_sex_counts %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = n, color = sex)) +
    geom_line() +
    facet_wrap(~ species_id, nrow = 1)
  # One row, facet by columns
```

Now let's use `facet_grid()` to control how panels are organized by both rows 
and columns:

```{r facet6, fig.width = 9.5}
yearly_sex_counts %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = n, color = sex)) +
    geom_line() +
    facet_grid(sex  ~ species_id)
```



>## Challenge 7
>
> Use what you just learned to create a plot that depicts how the average weight
> of each species changes through the years. 
> Play around with which variable you facet by versus plot by!

```{r challenge-7, error=TRUE}
## To get you started:  
yearly_species_weight <- surveys %>% 
  group_by(year, species_id) %>%
  ## Variables to group by
  summarize(avg_weight = mean(weight))

## Edit the following ggplot() code for the plot here:
yearly_species_weight %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = n, color = avg_weight)) +
    geom_line() +
    facet_wrap(facets =  ~ species_id)
## Your ggplot() code for the plot goes here!

```

```{r challenge-7-solution}
## To get you started:  
yearly_species_weight <- surveys %>% 
  ## Variables to group by:
  group_by(year, species_id) %>%
  summarize(avg_weight = mean(weight))

## Coloring by species id
yearly_species_weight %>% 
ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = avg_weight, color = species_id)) +
    geom_line()

## Faceting by species id
yearly_species_weight %>% 
ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = avg_weight, color = species_id)) +
    geom_line() + 
  facet_wrap(~ species_id)

```



## **`ggplot2`** Themes

Usually plots with white background look more readable when printed. 
Every single component of a `ggplot()` graph can be customized using the generic 
`theme()` function, as we will see below. However, there are pre-loaded themes 
available that change the overall appearance of the graph without much effort. 

For example, we can change our previous graph to have a simpler white background 
using the `theme_bw()` function:

```{r themes1, fig.height=3, fig.width=6}
yearly_sex_counts %>% 
 ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = n, color = sex)) +
     geom_line() +
     facet_wrap(~ species_id) +
     theme_bw()
```

In addition to `theme_bw()`, which changes the plot background to white, 
**`ggplot2`**comes with several other themes which can be useful to quickly 
change the look of your visualization. The complete list of themes is available
at <https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html>. `theme_minimal()` and
`theme_light()` are popular, and `theme_void()` can be useful as a starting
point to create a new hand-crafted theme.

The
[ggthemes](https://jrnold.github.io/ggthemes/reference/index.html) package
provides a wide variety of options.
The [**`ggplot2`** extensions website](https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) provides a 
list of packages that extend the capabilities of **`ggplot2`**, including 
additional themes.


>## Challenge 8
>
> Use what you just learned to add the plotting background theme 
> of your choosing to the plot you made in Challenge 7!

```{r challenge-8}
## Your ggplot() code for the plot goes here!

```

```{r challenge-8-solution}
yearly_species_weight %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = avg_weight, color = species_id)) +
  geom_line() + 
  theme_classic()

```


## Customization {#customization}

Take a look at the [**`ggplot2`** cheat sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/data-visualization-2.1.pdf), 
and think of ways you could improve the previous plot.

### Plot Labels 

Now, let's change names of axes to something more informative than 'year'
and 'n' and add a title to the figure. Label customizations are done using the 
`labs()` function like so:

```{r labels}
yearly_sex_counts %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = n, color = sex)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ species_id) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Observed Species Through Time",
       x = "Year of Observation",
       y = "Number of Rodents",  
       color = "Sex") 
```

>**Tip: Wrapping Titles**    
>
>Sometimes the titles we wish to have for our plots are longer than the space 
>originally allotted. If you create a title and the text is running off the plot
>you can add a `\n` inside your title to force a line break 
>(`\n` stands for new line).  


### Label & Plot Fonts 

Note that it is also possible to change the fonts of your plots. If you are on
Windows, you may have to install
the [**`extrafont`** package](https://github.com/wch/extrafont), and follow the
instructions included in the README for this package.

In the last plot, the axes have more informative names, but their readability 
can be improved by increasing the font size. This can be done with the generic
`theme()` function. 

```{r fonts}
yearly_sex_counts %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = n, color = sex)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ species_id) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Observed Species Through Time",
      x = "Year of Observation",
      y = "Number of Rodents", 
      color = "Sex") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 16))
    ## sets ALL the text on the plot to be size 16
```

**Note:**  
`theme_bw()` is a function for a **specific** theme and `theme()` is a
generic function for a **variety** of different themes!  

After our manipulations, you may notice that the values on the x-axis are still 
not properly readable. Let's swap the orientation of the labels, so the reader 
doesn't have to tilt their head when reading our plot! The `coord_flip()` 
function easily changes the x- and y-axis. 

```{r flip, fig.height=4, fig.width=6}
yearly_sex_counts %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = n, color = sex)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ species_id) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Observed Species by \n Year of Observation",
      x = "Year of Observation",
      y = "Number of Rodents", 
      color = "Sex") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 16)) + 
  coord_flip()
    
```

This definitely makes the reader tilt their head less! But, the text on the 
x-axis is a bit too large to separate the numbers. We can specify the text size 
for each element of the plot independently, if we so wish. This would look 
something like this:  

```{r text-size, fig.height=4, fig.width=6}
yearly_sex_counts %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = n, color = sex)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ species_id) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Observed Species by Year of Observation",
        x = "",
        y = "Number of Rodents", 
        color = "Sex") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10), 
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12), 
        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 14),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 12),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 12),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 16)) + 
  coord_flip()
    
```


### Legend Position

By default in `ggplot2` the legend is positioned on the right hand side. 
However, you are able to change the position of the legend to the left hand 
side, the top of the plot, or the bottom of the plot. 

This is done by adding a `legend.position` theme to the plot's `theme()`'s. 

```{r legend-pos, fig.height=4, fig.width=6}
yearly_sex_counts %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = n, color = sex)) +
    geom_line() +
    facet_wrap(~ species_id) +
    labs(title = "Observed Species by Year of Observation by Sex",
        x = "Year of Observation",
        y = "Number of Rodents", 
        color = "Sex") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10), 
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12), 
        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 14),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 12),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 14),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 14), 
        legend.position = "top") + 
  coord_flip()
    
```


### Removing Grid Lines 

By default, the background of a `ggplot()` contains both minor and major 
gridlines. These can make the plot look a bit busy and sometimes difficult for the reader 
to follow. As you may have guessed, to remove these gridlines, we add another
theme to our plot. 

This looks like this:

```{r remove-grid, fig.height=4, fig.width=6}
yearly_sex_counts %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = n, color = sex)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ species_id) +
  labs(title = "Observed Species by Year of Observation by Sex",
      x = "Year of Observation",
      y = "Number of Rodents", 
      color = "Sex") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10), 
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12), 
        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 14),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 12),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 14),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 14), 
        legend.position = "top", 
        ## New themes for the grid lines
        axis.line = element_line(color = "black"),
        ## 
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.border = element_blank(), 
        panel.background = element_blank()) + 
  coord_flip()
    
```

Let's break these options down!  

- The `axis.line` option declares what color the x- and y-axis lines should be. 
(Change it to a different color, if you don't believe me!)
- The `panel.grid.major` removes the major grid (the one associated with the 
ticks from the x- and y-axis).  
- The `panel.grid.minor` removes the minor grid (the one *between* the x- and 
y-axis ticks).  
- The `panel.border` removes the border around the plot.  
- The `panel.background` performs a similar action to `theme_bw()`, but it keeps 
the border around the facet labels.    


### Changing Colors 

The built in `ggplot()` color scheme may not be what you were looking for, but 
don't worry! There are many other color palettes available to use!  

You can change the colors used by `ggplot()` a few different ways.  

#### Manual Specification 

Add the `scale_color_manual()` or `scale_fill_manual()` functions to your 
plot and directly specify the colors you want to use. You can either:  

- defining a vector of colors right there (e.g. `values = c("blue", "black", "red", "green")`)  

- creating a vector of colors and storing it in an object and calling it 
(see below)

```{r manual-colors}
# A color deficient friendly palette with grey:
cbPalette_grey <- c("#999999", "#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73", "#F0E442", 
                    "#0072B2", "#D55E00", "#CC79A7")

# A color deficient friendly palette with black:
cbPalette_blk <- c("#000000", "#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73", "#F0E442", 
                   "#0072B2", "#D55E00", "#CC79A7")

surveys %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = species_id, y = hindfoot_length, color = genus)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_color_manual(values = cbPalette_grey)

surveys %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = species_id, y = hindfoot_length, color = genus)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_color_manual(values = cbPalette_blk)


```

#### Package Specification 

Install a package and use it's available color scales. Popular options 
include:  

- `RColorBrewer`: using `scale_fill_brewer()` or `scale_color_brewer()` 

- `viridis`: using `scale_color_viridis_d()` for discrete data, 
`scale_color_viridis_c()` for continuous data, with an inside 
argument of `option = <COLOR>` for your chosen color scheme  

- `ggsci`: using `scale_color_<PALNAME>()` or `scale_fill_<PALNAME>()`, where
you specify the name of the palette you wish to use (e.g., `scale_color_aaas()`)

```




## Arranging Plots

Faceting is a great tool for splitting one plot into multiple plots, but 
sometimes you may want to produce a single figure that contains multiple plots 
using different variables or even different data frames. The **`gridExtra`** 
package allows us to combine separate ggplots into a single figure using 
`grid.arrange()` (make sure to scroll down in the window to see all the code):

```{r arrange, message = FALSE, fig.width = 10, fig.height=6}
library(gridExtra)

spp_weight_boxplot <- surveys %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = genus, y = weight)) +
  geom_violin() +
  geom_jitter(color = "tomato", width = 0.2, alpha = 0.2) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  ## log (base 10) transforms the y-axis variable
  ## (helps to make the plot less skewed)
  labs(x = "", 
       ## removes the y-axis label
       y = expression(Log[10](Weight))) +
       ## Expression creates a mathematical expression in the axis label
       ## the [10] refers to the subscript next to Log
  coord_flip() + 
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12), 
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12), 
        text = element_text(size = 16))

spp_count_plot <- yearly_counts %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = n, color = genus)) +
  geom_line() + 
  labs(x = "Year", 
       y = "Abundance", 
       color = "Genus") +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(face = "bold", size = 12))
  ## To make your axis title boldface, this is what you need!

grid.arrange(spp_weight_boxplot, spp_count_plot, ncol = 2, widths = c(4, 6))
## nrow and ncol specify how many rows/columns you want the arranged plots to be in
## widths specify what proportion of the overall plotting area each plot takes up
```

In addition to the `ncol` and `nrow` arguments, used to make simple arrangements,
there are tools for [constructing more complex layouts](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gridExtra/vignettes/arrangeGrob.html). 


For more assistance arranging plots with `grid.arrage()`. We find the following 
vignette **very** helpful! https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/egg/vignettes/Ecosystem.html

Another option for combining plots is the [patchwork package](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/). It uses a sort of formula interface for defining the layout of multiple plots. For example, you can get two plots side-by-side in a one row, two column array with `p1 + p2` and two plots stacked into two rows and one column with `p1 / p2`. This provides both a quick and powerful way to arrange ggplots you have created.
						   

```{r arrange2, message = FALSE, fig.width = 10, fig.height=6}
spp_weight_boxplot / spp_count_plot

```


## Exporting Plots 
 

After creating your plot, you can save it to a file in your favorite format. The
Export tab in the **Plot** pane in RStudio will save your plots at low 
resolution, which will not be accepted by many journals and will not scale well 
for posters. 

Instead, use the `ggsave()` function, which allows you easily change the 
dimension and resolution of your plot by adjusting the appropriate arguments:  

- `width` and `height`: adjust the total plot size in units ("in", "cm", or "mm")
  * If units are not specified, default is inches. 
- `dpi`: adjusts the plot resolution. This accepts a string or numeric input: 
    * "retina" (320)
    * "print" (300) 
    * "screen" (72)
    
Make sure you have the `fig/` folder in your working directory.

```{r export, fig.height=4, fig.width=6}
my_plot <- ggplot(data = yearly_sex_counts, 
                  mapping = aes(x = year, y = n, color = sex)) +
              geom_line() +
              facet_wrap(~ species_id) +
              labs(title = "Observed genera through time",
                    x = "Year of observation",
                    y = "Number of individuals") +
              theme_bw() +
              coord_flip() + 
              theme(axis.text.y = element_text(color = "grey20", size = 12),
                    text = element_text(size = 16))

ggsave("fig/yearly_sex_counts.png", my_plot, width = 15, height = 10)

# This also works for grid.arrange() plots
combo_plot <- grid.arrange(spp_weight_boxplot, spp_count_plot, 
                           ncol = 2, widths = c(4, 6))

ggsave("fig/combo_plot_abun_weight.png", combo_plot, width = 10, dpi = 300)
```

> **Note:** 
> The parameters `width` and `height` also determine the font size in the 
> saved plot.


## Suggestions for your own work

The goal of this workshop was to teach you to write code in `R` to learn data visualization using `ggplot2`. The first workshop in our series contains more information on how to get started working in `R` using RStudio (see http://www.montana.edu/datascience/training/). The code chunks in this interactive document mimic the code chunks you can use on your own projects in RMarkdown but you will need to download and install both `R` and RStudio on your own computer. 

### Interactive Graphics (Bonus Material)


In certain situations, static displays can limit the sorts of information available and do not allow easy interrogation for information on individual aspects of plots. Obviously, most print journals do not have a way to have readers interact with the printed page, but in digital venues there are some possibilities. Of particular interest here are interactive graphics that can function on websites and in blog posts or even in certain presentation formats. One way to do this that leverages the previous work in making `ggplot`-style graphics is using the `ggplotly` function from the `plotly` R package (Sievert, 2020). You can access the 2020 book that goes into more detail on `plotly`-style graphics at https://plotly-r.com/. 

To use `ggplotly`, we wrap that function around a `ggplot` object and it will render it in an interactive fashion when the viewer hovers over individual plot components. There are also ways of making `plotly` graphs directly using `plot_ly` and that may prove easier for some things, for example for making interactive three-dimensional graphs. 

Here are two examples that we worked with earlier converted into `ggplotly` objects that allow further interrogation of the information displayed:

```{r plotlydemo, message = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(plotly)

spp_weight_boxplot <- surveys %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = genus, y = weight)) +
  geom_violin() +
  geom_jitter(color = "tomato", width = 0.2, alpha = 0.2) + 
  scale_y_log10() +
  ## log (base 10) transforms the y-axis variable
  ## (helps to make the plot less skewed)
  labs(x = "", 
       ## removes the y-axis label
       y = "log10-Weight") +
  coord_flip() + #Switches x and y axes
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12), 
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12), 
        text = element_text(size = 16)) +
  theme_bw()

spp_count_plot <- yearly_counts %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = n, color = genus)) +
  geom_line() + 
  labs(x = "Year", 
       y = "Abundance", 
       color = "Genus") +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(face = "bold", size = 12)) +
  theme_bw()

ggplotly(spp_weight_boxplot);ggplotly(spp_count_plot)
```



One note about using `plotly` graphics in R-markdown is that they will not knit into word or PDF formats, only into HTML (in word or PDF, you are stuck with static images but you could incorporate a link to a website containing the interactive version of the plot). You can also interact with plots when working in markdown or running code in the console in RStudio. For presentations, you can also record a video of interactions with plot to remove some challenges of live presentations using this format. But if you are looking to wow your viewers in a digital format, need to dig into some details of what is displayed in a plot quickly, or when static graphics are limiting your story-telling ability, remember that there might be another option!

**Happy plotting!**
